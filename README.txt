This is a weather application that lets users sign in and add locations they want to receive weather from. If they are not signed in they just see the weather for Aurora, Illinois which is where I live :)

Uses Django framework with Postgres database. 
Deployed application using digital ocean. 

I stopped the website so now it is no longer online :( . I wasn't using it and it took money to keep online.

I think I might need to do this to see github pushes to webpages: 
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
